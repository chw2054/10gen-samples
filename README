Several sample sites using Python on 10gen.

If you're just starting with Python on 10gen you should look at the
"three-templates" site first. After understanding that look at the "student"
site next, which gives a more thorough look at Python on 10gen. "basic" is
meant as a proof of concept and not a tutorial.

Tutorial documentation can also be reached from our main developer documentation
page, here: http://www.10gen.com/wiki/DevDocumentation
